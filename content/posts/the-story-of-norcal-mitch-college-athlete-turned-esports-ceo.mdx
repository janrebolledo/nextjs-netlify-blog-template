Mitchell Allan, better known as NorCal Mitch, started as a three-sport high school athlete who loved to play video games with his friends. In 2017, He began to realize that this could be more than just friends playing games together. Since that realization, he has amassed a roster of over 100 dedicated members and over 500,000 supporters across six social media platforms. Today I was able to sit down with him and listen to his story.

## **In The Beginning…**

When asked what got him into gaming, Mitch replied with a laugh, “I’m actually more of a sports person. I was a three-sport high school athlete and a two-sport college athlete, and I think what got me into gaming was competitiveness.” In high school, Mitch played Football, Basketball, and Baseball. After graduating, he went to play Football and Baseball in college at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, California. His high school claim to fame is beating Lonzo Ball in a Division I basketball state championship game. When not playing sports, Mitch found gaming to be a great outlet for his competitive side. “I got into Call of Duty back in 5th or 6th grade, and then realized I could be competitive there so I stuck with it,” Mitch says he didn’t play many video games in high school but came back to them once in college. “While in college I realized I had a lot of time on my hands, kind of got back into gaming, and wanted to start my own team.” Mitch says his favorite video game of all time is either the original or remastered version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. “I guess I just grew up playing that game so much and got pretty good. It got to a point where I was able to make my own videos and montages.” He also said, “there’s nothing that beats running home to play a private match of Search and Destroy with your friends, I definitely miss that.” When it comes to Mitch’s entry into the esports scene, it came from wanting to help his friend join a larger team. “I realized he could join a team, but he was having trouble getting his name out there.” To help his friend, Mitch started his own team and looked to other teams such as Red Reserve and Optic Gaming for inspiration. “I knew I liked to do video stuff… and realized that if I took his clips and my clips, we could make some montages, and start our own team.” Ironically enough, Mitch was in a team called NorCal in middle school that ended up not getting very far, and he decided to bring it back during college. He began to realize that it could be something bigger than just two friends playing games when their videos started to gain traction on Instagram, and he began to build a community with his followers. The original NorCal YouTube channel was deleted in 2017, but that did not discourage Mitch, who decided to bring it back in 2018. “I started realizing that this is actually a business that can be marketed,” and took it upon himself to attempt to turn a little into a lot. Mitch was no stranger to leadership roles, having been captain of his college football team. He decided to bring his leadership and communication skills to the Esports industry and wanted to build a foundation not based on online friendships, but real interaction and family.

## Full-Time Esports CEO

After college, Mitch was offered a job as a Linebacker coach at a college, which he had decided he was going to take. Three weeks before the season started, he changed his mind decided to not take the job and focus on NorCal full time. This was met with some skepticism from those around him, but ultimately they knew that if he wanted it, he was going to go get it. “I don’t think anyone really doubted me, but there were definitely some questions.” After seeing the passion and drive Mitch had, those around him began to support him in his journey into Esports. “Having to sit down with my parents and tell them that I won’t be going to coach football and doing a video game team full time was definitely a struggle,” said Mitch. However, after explaining to his parents how he would be able to support himself and telling them his plans, they began to fully support him in his decision. Like many other successful CEOs in Esports and business in general, Mitch got to his position by not doubting his ability and believing in himself. “I’ve never doubted NorCal, I’ve always believed in it. I’m the kind of person that if things start to not work out, I’m going to work even harder to make sure they do.” Mitch says that as long as you surround yourself with like-minded people that you respect and that respect you, you can make it out of anything. Mitch also believes that self-confidence is not the only path to success, but also confidence in those around you. “I sit there every day and make sure my players are confident in themselves, I can’t run this team without them.” Being the CEO of NorCal Esports, Mitch’s schedule is changing every day. He sets every morning aside for personal time, where he works out and prepares himself for the day. When not talking to players or management, he is streaming on the official NorCal account on Twitch, a livestreaming platform centered around gaming. “Honestly the biggest thing is just checking in with people and making sure everything is up to date.” One thing that sets Mitch apart is he purposefully schedules more than he needs in case something goes awry with one of the other tasks. “I like to kind of overload my schedule, that way in case someone is going through a rough time, their computer breaks, or something like that I can make up for the lack of production.” When asked how his life would be if he hadn’t committed to NorCal, Mitch replied “It would be sad.” Mitch says that if he would have coached Football full time he would have only been able to coach and teach the eleven people on the field, which he didn’t want. He wanted more than that. “What started to make me branch into starting NorCal is the idea of spreading positivity, and helping guide more people than I could before. From the day I started NorCal, I haven’t been sad a day in my life.” Mitch calls NorCal “much more than just a video game team,” and calls it a way to grow and receive support all while reciprocating that support for others. “I see NorCal as a family, and hopefully everyone else does too.” To round out the answer, Mitch had this to say: “I get to wake up happy as hell every single day, I get to help people achieve their dreams, and there’s not really much more you can ask for in life.” Mitch recalls a few of his favorite moments in NorCal so far being meeting up with everyone at Dreamhack Anaheim in 2019, and the acquisitions of the NorCal house in September of 2020 and the GFUEL house in June of this year.

## Future Plans and Reflections

When asked what the biggest goal he had for NorCal was, Mitch said “I want to make the biggest impact possible, whether that’s on a local or global scale. I want to give back. I want to do charity events with NorCal, I want people to learn from NorCal, and I want to be able to teach people that the internet can be used for some amazing things. So many people sit behind a screen and talk with no repercussions, but if they realize that we can use these platforms for good, we can truly make a change.” When asked if there was a dream company that Mitch would want to partner with, he said his dream would be to partner with the Make-A-Wish foundation. Mitch has previously worked with Make-A-Wish to raise money for the foundation and was able to see someone’s wish come true. “A partnership with Make-A-Wish would be great, not because it would help fund our organization, but because it would be an honor to be a part of something much bigger than all of us. So many people deal with things in their lives that take turns which force them to rely on others, and I want to be a part of making sure that people know when we all come together, we can make life a lot better for those less fortunate than us.” To those who have supported Mitch from the beginning, he has this to say: “First off, I want to say thank you for believing in me and I want you to know that I believe in you just as much. My messages are always open, and I want to do my best to give back to those as much as possible. At the end of the day, even if you can’t reach us, I hope our content gives you a reason to smile and makes each day a little happier.” If you find yourself on the opposite end of the spectrum, Mitch wants to thank you. “I could go with the cliché thank you and say my haters are my motivators, but honestly at the end of the day I know people don’t have bad hearts. They may be going through something in their lives that could be affecting them and making them want to put others down. I just wish them well and hope whatever they are going through gets better. Life is about learning, and learning that putting other people down is not the best way to bring yourself happiness and it’s better to live life with positivity is an important lesson. I hope that that light shines down on them one day and they can realize how successful this world can be if we all lived with positivity.”

## Advice & Encouragement

Looking to become a part of NorCal? Here’s what Mitch and his associates are looking for. “My number one answer is heart. I want to see how much they care and how much they want to be here. Not for the numbers, not for the money, but looking for opportunities to continue to do what they love to do and make the most out of every situation. It’s pretty obvious to tell who wants it and who doesn’t just based off of their reactions to events. Everyone has ups and downs, and how you react to that shows a lot about someone.” The second thing Mitch looks for in a NorCal member is influence. “I want to see people like you because of you, not because of your content or gameplay. We have a lot of streamers, because I think streaming is such a good method of influence as you can directly influence and inspire people in real time.” The last but certainly not least thing Mitch wants in a member is consistency. Keeping a consistent stream of content and personality is a great way to gain and retain a community. “When heart, influence, and consistency come together, it’s pretty hard to stop anybody.”

Looking to start your own Esports organization? Mitch has some advice for you as well. “The biggest tip I can give is don’t start an organization, start a friend group that you want to run and manage. To get to where I’m at today, it takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of money, and it takes a lot of patience. Most people aren’t patient enough to get to that spot. I would start with just a friend group and start small. Start with a group of people you know and trust and build and grow from there. I never grew at a rate where I wasn’t able to individually message and check out with people, and I think that’s big. Also, be prepared to make sacrifices. You have to make sacrifices to make it, and you can’t build your way up in this community for free. So many people want to start the next big organization and sign all these big players and these big content creators, but fail to start bringing money in. That’s where you see a lot of attempted organizations failing. Definitely start with a friend group, and if a friend group works out, start building into a team.” The largest thing to understand is that building an organization is a long process. It does not happen overnight, and if you’re patient and believe in yourself, and you love what you do, you can eventually find yourself leading an organization.”
